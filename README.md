## Introduction

This week, you’ll learn about object-relational mapping (ORM), a technique that allows developers to convert data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming principles. 
You’ll work with Sequelize, an ORM library that creates a virtual object database that can be used within your code while managing a relational database. 
This will allow you to set up and completely manage objects using JavaScript, while Sequelize translates your code into database schema and queries using SQL.

## Acceptance Criteria

Configure the Sequelize ORM in a Node.js application.

Create models for categories, products, and tags in a relational database and a through table that will connect the product and tag models.

Define and implement CRUD methods, using Sequelize to interact with your models in each API endpoint through proper RESTful commands (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Create and implement Sequelize associations to join tables.

Use environment variables to protect sensitive data, such as your MySQL username and password.
